-----------------------------------------

The NSF's OIR Lab Astro Data Archive (formerly NOAO Science Archive)
provides access to data taken with more than 40 telescope and
instrument combinations, including those operated in partnership with
the WIYN, SOAR and SMARTS consortia, from semester 2004B to the
present. In addition to raw data, pipeline-reduced data products from
the DECam, Mosaic and NEWFIRM imagers are also available, as well as
advanced data products delivered by teams carrying out surveys and
other large observing programs with NSF OIR Lab facilities.
